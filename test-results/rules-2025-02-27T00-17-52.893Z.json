        "Implement error handling in a single place using interceptors to avoid repetitive catch blocks in every request.",
        "Leverage the `validateStatus` option to customize which HTTP status codes should be treated as errors, allowing for more granular control over error handling.",
        "Use `Promise.all` for concurrent requests to optimize performance when making multiple API calls."
