        "Utilize interceptors to handle requests and responses globally, allowing for easier error handling and request modification.",
        "Implement error handling by checking the response status and using the `catch` method to manage errors gracefully.",
        "Leverage async/await syntax for cleaner asynchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.",
        "Optimize performance by using `Promise.all` for concurrent requests, allowing multiple API calls to be made simultaneously."
