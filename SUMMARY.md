# Cursor Rules Generator API - Summary

## Overview

The Cursor Rules Generator API is a service designed to generate usage rules for packages based on their documentation. It leverages the Firecrawl API to search for and extract information from package documentation, then processes and stores this information in a structured format in a PostgreSQL database.

## Architecture

The application is built with the following technologies:

- **Node.js & Express**: For the API server
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **Prisma ORM**: For database operations with PostgreSQL
- **Firecrawl API**: For documentation search and extraction
- **Winston**: For comprehensive logging

## Core Components

### 1. Express Server (`src/index.ts`)

- Configures and starts the Express application
- Sets up middleware for request handling and logging
- Defines routes and error handling

### 2. Package Rules Controller (`src/controllers/packageRulesController.ts`)

- Handles requests to generate package rules
- Processes each package by checking the database first
- Coordinates with FirecrawlService to search and extract documentation
- Stores results in the database and returns them to the client

### 3. FirecrawlService (`src/services/firecrawl.ts`)

- Provides interfaces to the Firecrawl API
- Handles documentation search and information extraction
- Supports a test mode for development and testing without API calls

### 4. Data Models (Prisma Schema)

- `PackageRule`: Stores generated package rules
  - Fields: packageName, category, instructions, timestamps

## Key Features

1. **Package Rules Generation**

   - Accept a list of package names
   - Check the database for existing rules
   - Search for package documentation
   - Extract usage tips and instructions
   - Store results in the database
   - Return structured data to the client

2. **Test Mode**

   - Execute the API without calling external services
   - Generate mock data for testing and development
   - Controlled via environment variable (`TEST_MODE=true`)

3. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging with different levels
   - Console output in development
   - File-based logs for production and debugging

## API Endpoints

### Generate Rules

- **URL**: `/api/package-rules/generate`
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**: `{ "packages": ["axios", "express", ...] }`
- **Response**: JSON with success status and package rules data

## Setup and Usage

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Database connection string
   - API keys (Firecrawl)
   - Port configuration
   - Test mode flag

2. **Development Mode**

   - `yarn dev` to start the development server
   - `yarn test:client` to run the test client

3. **Test Mode**
   - Set `TEST_MODE=true` in `.env` file
   - FirecrawlService will return mock data instead of calling the API

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Rule Processing**

   - Improve extraction prompts for better quality rules
   - Add validation for extracted data

2. **Authentication & Rate Limiting**

   - Add API key authentication
   - Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

3. **Enhanced Test Coverage**

   - Add unit tests for controllers and services
   - Add integration tests for the API endpoints

4. **UI Dashboard**
   - Add a web interface for managing and viewing rules
   - Provide analytics on rule usage and coverage
